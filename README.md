# ClothingStateMenu
Plugin for character makers of some games made by Illusion (Koikatu, Koikatsu Party, EmotionCreators) that adds ability to toggle state of clothes and accessories. This makes it easy to see how clothes look when partially removed (useful for making clothes overlays) and to make partially dressed character card preview images.

Based on the original ClothingStateMenu plugin made by essu.

### How to use
1. Make sure at least [BepInEx v5.0](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx), [KKAPI v1.5](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/KKAPI) and latest MoreAccessories for your game (if any are available) are installed, and your game is updated.
2. Download the latest release.
3. Extract the release to your game root. The plugin .dll should end up inside your BepInEx\plugins folder. Overwrite if asked.
4. Remove BepInEx\ClothingStateMenu.dll if you have it (this is the old version).
5. Start character maker. You should see a new checkbox in the bottom right corner. You can configure this plugin in plugin settings by searching for its name.
